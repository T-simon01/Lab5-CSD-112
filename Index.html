    <h1> Welcome to Trinity's Website! </h1>
   <p1> Hi my name is Trinity, im from manitoulin island.
     im currently enrolled at sault college and am studying Computer Programming.
     I like to be outdoors doing things like hiking, fishing, and quading. 
     I have a pitbull named nova and she also like to be outdoors. I was born in Sault Ste. 
     Marie but lived on Manitoulin Island most of my life. Living on manitoulin island was 
     abit of a hassle for certain things like going to the grocery store because the closest one 
     near me was 45 minutes away, in snowy weather there would be quite alot of cars in the ditch. 
     When I was in grade 3 I started to move around and switch schools alot first school moved to was an hour drive away from
     my home, and then I moved to a closer school which was a 45 minute drive, and I was back and forth for a few years. My whole school experience was
     Pretty hectic so when i got to highschool i decided to do homeschooling, which was better than the long drives early in the morining.
